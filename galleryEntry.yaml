We implemented a game of standard blackjack. When the game starts, the interface 
asks for number of players. Single players will play against the 
computer. Multi-player implementations get to choose up to 4 additional players.
The computer is the dealer. Module types exist for players and cards. The backend will
return the pair of cards for each respective player. Rounds will ask each 
player whether they would like to hit or stand. Hit will result in the dealing 
of a new card. If it’s an Ace, the player can count it as a 1 or 11. Stand ends 
that player’s turn, and then after everyone has gone, the winning player’s name 
and the scores will be printed.
